# MultiPurpose-Bot

# To set up:
# 1) Create your own Bot at https://discord.com/developers/applications
# 2) Get your Bot's token and give it "Administration" permissions
# 3) In the OAuth2 section, under URL generator, give the bot the "bot" scope and choose "Administrator" Permissions. You should now see a URL for your bot on your screen
# 4) Paste your Bot's Token into the Token string variable in main.py
# 5) Paste the URL you generated in step 3 into your browser and add the bot to any server you are an admin in!
# 6) If there isn't one already, create a "bot" channel in your discord server, this is where the bot will be able to talk!
